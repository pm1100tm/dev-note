# Docker and docker-compose

In this section, we will cover Docker and docker-compose. Docker is a tool used
to package and deploy applications as containers, and docker-compose is a tool
for defining and running multiple containers. We will learn more about how to
build and manage a development environment using these two tools. We will also
cover how to write Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml files, how to manage
containers, and examples of their use in real-world projects.
